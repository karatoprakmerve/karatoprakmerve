<h1> 👩🏻‍🚀 Hi, This is Merve speaking!</h1>

<p>
  Very warm welcome to my GitHub profile. I've always been curious about the world of coding and I've taken many courses in this field before. However, I     finally started my Front-End Development journey in 2022 (YAAYY 🎉)  
  
👩🏻‍💻 I'm getting Front-End Developer Specialization which Meta manages through Coursera. 
  As part of this, I've completed the courses below:
  <ul>
    <li>Introduction to Front-End Development</li>
    <li>Programming with <b>JavaScript</b></li>
    <li>In-depth <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b></li>
    <li><b>Version Control</b></li>
  </ul>

🌱 Currently, I continue to learn <b>React</b> and <b>UX/UI Design Principles</b>.

✨ My biggest <i>inspiration</i> is nature, music and art.
   
👀 I specifically interested in <i>space</i> and <i>analogue photography</i>.
